\section{Conclusion\textsuperscript{1}}
In this paper, we proposed an architecture for management and payment processing of vending machines between the triangular business relationship: manufacturer, contractor and location provider. We compared different Distributed Ledger Technologies and implemented a proof-of-concept for a coffee machine. The proof-of-concept implementation showed that the requirements defined in the Section Methods, can indeed be fulfilled with a permissioned blockchain approach. It also revealed difficulties of the customer identification via Bluetooth. In general the detection distance of Beacon is only controlled by the sensitivity of the receiver, while the sender is not able to reduce its transmission power. With this, a nearby attacker is able to receive and clone the Beacon information in order to identify and pay with the victims account. Future improvements of the proposed solution would be, to implement alternatives to Bluetooth Beacons or the usage of onetime Beacons.  

While the proposed approach provides only basic analytical insights, future development could provide advanced sales forecasting capabilities and vending machine fault detection by automated analyzing of the transaction history.

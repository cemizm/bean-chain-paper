\begin{abstract}
In context of rising pay-per-use business models, we envision a triangular profit-sharing business relationship between a vending machine manufacturer, contractors responsible for machine maintenance and location providers for machine installation. Besides, we facilitate the future adoption of this architecture by developing a system which also provides benefits for vending machine customers. We identify the lack of trust as the main problem in a centralized profit-sharing system. 
Centralized systems do not provide a trusted environment for all participants where manipulation of sales figures is impossible. 
In this paper, we propose an blockchain-based architecture for management and payment processing of this presented system. We compare the properties of different Distributed Ledger Technologies to implement a proof-of-concept by using a coffee machine.
